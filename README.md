Alternative Bink Files for ATC TV

Currenty there are two smaller and one larger videos available. Miami Vice Intro and Cheezy 80's Werewolf, both are smaller single files. MTV Intro Videos is over an hour long and split into two zip files to meet with github file size constraint. Download both MTV_Intros.zip001 and MTV_Intros.zip002 then unzip the files in the same location to obtain the MTV_Intros.bk2 file.

In the RetroVRArade\Content\Movies\Bink\tv folder of ATC rename the thefallguy.bk2 something else i.e. thefallguy_bak.bk2 to back it up. Copy the desired bk2 replacement file into the same folder and name it thefallguy.bk2.

That's it.
