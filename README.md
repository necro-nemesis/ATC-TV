Alternative Bink Files for ATC TV

Currenty two small files available. Miami Vice Intro and Cheezy 80's Werewolf intentionally bad transformation.

In the RetroVRArade\Content\Movies\Bink\tv folder of ATC rename thefallguy.bk2 something else i.e. thefallguy_bak.bk2 to back it up. Copy the desired bk2 replacement file into the same folder and name it thefallguy.bk2.

That's it.
